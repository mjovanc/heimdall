                <h1>The new standard for communicating privately.</h1>
                <p>
                    Hugin Messenger is a decentralized private messenger and social network with native cryptocurrency
                    payments.
                    With it you can engage in secure communications and make untraceable transactions, all without any
                    trusted parties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many private messaging services on the market today, but how private they really are is a
                    point of debate, and often you have to take their promises at face value.
                    Due to parts of their system being closed source, or them having opaque distribution lines, like
                    with Google Play or the Apple App Store (1) you have to trust the developer’s competence and
                    intentions.
                    In addition, centralized systems such as Signal, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger etc are dependent on a
                    specific company’s servers and they can become subjected to coercion by third parties,
                    which could lead to shutdowns, forced decryption of private messages, censorship, as well as abuse
                    of power.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Centralized server structures, even if distributed, can fall victim to censorship by authoritarian
                    regimes that shun freedom of speech, such as the case where Signal was censored in Iran, leading
                    Signal to obfuscate
                    their server’s origin with the Amazon owned domain name Souq.com. Amazon responded with threats to
                    take down their services at AWS, which could have lead to serious outages, or at worst putting a
                    halt to the network (2).
                </p>

                <p>
                    To build a private messaging service that evades these potential issues altogether, the entire
                    infrastructure for transmission, storage and client-side applications must be based on open source
                    and decentralized technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By being decentralized it is possible to protect the network from being censored, taken offline, or
                    somehow being made unavailable, simply because there is no
                    single point of failure - you would have to shut down every node in the network to effectively shut
                    the network down, and even then, new nodes could join the network at any time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Decentralization also lends another important prerequisite for privacy, which is permissionless
                    operation. In traditional centralized systems, a central authority controls permissions, perhaps
                    forcing you to give up personal information
                    to use the network. In a decentralized system, there is no such authority.
                    Anyone can interact with the network at any time, without limitations other than those - in Hugin’s
                    case - consensus rules that govern the network, and those are always the same for all users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another positive feature of decentralization is that it can make certain operations a lot less
                    costly, and in turn more scalable. In Hugin Messenger, for example, you can make true peer-2-peer
                    calls,
                    where the data is only travelling between you, and your recipient. In a centralized system, that
                    call would be relayed through a centralized server, costing the centralized entity valuable
                    resources,
                    in turn causing an incentive for it to profit off of the user’s interactions with their service. It
                    is feasible that such calls are transcribed, analyzed, and hopefully anonymized, before being sold
                    as data for profit.
                    Hugin is immune to this race to make more profit, as server cost’s increase due to user base growth
                    and data volume. This is achieved simply because the data is stored in the peer-2-peer network,
                    the bulk of it only between the affected parties - such as in calls, file sharing and more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By being open source, users and experts can combine efforts to scrutinize the source code, making
                    sure it’s safe and legitimate - a process that has been shown to create the most robust and reliable
                    systems over the decades (3).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hugin Messenger also lets you seamlessly send value transactions in combination with messages on the
                    same protocol, without needless fragmentation or complexity - in other words; Hugin was born to be a
                    combined messaging service
                    and a tool for transacting money that puts privacy first.
